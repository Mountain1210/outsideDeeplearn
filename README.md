# Neural Network in JavaScript with Deeplearn.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/javascript-machine-learning/mnist-neural-network-deeplearnjs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/javascript-machine-learning/mnist-neural-network-deeplearnjs)

Use Case: Learning best color matches of font and background color for an improved web accessibility.

This example project demonstrates how neural networks may be used to solve a binary classification problem. It uses [deeplearn.js](https://deeplearnjs.org/) to predict accessible font colors based on background colors.
